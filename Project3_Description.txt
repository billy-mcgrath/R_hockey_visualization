Caption: These maps highlight the countries that have birthed NHL players before and after 1960. The differences in the maps show how the game has grown internationally as more South American, African, and Asian born players have entered the league.Detailed Description:
I chose to look at where NHL hockey players have come from and how that has changed since 1960. I used a map to illustrate this data because it provides a visual representation of where players are coming from in a way that other graphs could not. I chose 1960 as the dividing year because the Soviet Union began to allow its hockey players to go play in the United States in the early 1990’s. These players were born around 1960, so I wanted to see if there was a significant change in the countries of origin after that point. There were Soviet hockey players that had defected before the 1990’s, so some Soviet countries had already birthed NHL players, but all have now birthed players since 1960. The maps also show that there has been an expansion of hockey outside of the Northern Hemisphere since 1960. Countries in Africa and Asia, continents that previously had no presence on the map, sent players to the NHL.Data Sources:
